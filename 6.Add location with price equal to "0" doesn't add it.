Title: 6.Add location with price equal to "0" doesn't add it.
Description: Adding a new location with correct name and prices equal to 0 does not add the new location.

Steps to Reproduce:

Step 2: Log into your account.
Step 3: Click on Add a location in the navbar.
Step 4 : Fill the fields with correct name and prices equal to 0.
Step 5 : Click the Add location button.
Step 6 : Affirm the "You have successfully added a location" message.



Expected Result:
When adding a location with a price equal to 0, technically you should be able to add the location, because the required price must be between 0 and 100.
